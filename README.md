It's *only* been 4 weeks!

Github is a useful 'one-stop-shop' where coding projects, resources, and other tools can be stored. It's a hub that can be synced with our local computer and directories to upload and download work that is done individually or collectively.

JavaScript is what brings life or action to a website. It seems to be harder to understand compared to HTML/CSS because it's less black and white with more room for interpretation(at least how I see it currently).  

**Thoughts**
1. To carry on from thoughts with JS, I think that's why I liked and somewhat comprehend Git & Bash. It's strictly 'this input = that output' and similar to MSDOS. There's less finesse involved compared to JavaScript.  
2. I struggle with understanding the total function concept so far. It's more of the 'why'    
3. Still confused with the return vs calling of a function. 
4. Finally understood in a return that a let statement does not have to precede the function. The 'string' or number can be inputted directly into the return statement.
5. Return functions also allow less code to be written if more inputs, that are similar, are inputted. Only need to write a separate 'let' statement with the unique string or numbers to be inputted the return statement.
